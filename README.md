# Number Guessing Game Project

## Overview

This Java project implements a Number Guessing Game. The game consists of three rounds, each allowing ten attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The player is prompted to input their guess, and the program provides feedback, indicating whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target. The player's score is based on the number of attempts remaining after a successful guess.

## Instructions

1. **Rounds and Attempts**: The game spans three rounds, and in each round, the player has ten attempts to guess the correct number.

2. **Scoring**: The player's score is calculated as the remaining attempts after successfully guessing the number. The total score is accumulated over all rounds.

## How to Play

1. Run the Java program.
2. Follow the prompts to input your guess within the specified range.
3. Receive feedback on each guess and try to guess the correct number within the allowed attempts.
4. After three rounds, the game concludes, displaying the total score.
